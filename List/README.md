A linked list is a `linear data structure` which can store data in random location. 
Every data is paired with an address which points to next consecutive data. The pair of data and pointer is known as `Node`.
<br>
Each node consists of two parts: <br>
1. Data
2. Pointer

Data part stores the data whereas Pointer stores the address of next node. The random placing of nodes in memory is made possible by pointer variable.
