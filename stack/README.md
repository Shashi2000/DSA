## Stack

A stack is an `abstract data type` (ADT) that holds an ordered, linear sequence of items. In contrast to a queue, a stack is a `last in, first out (LIFO)` structure. 
A real-life example is a stack of plates: you can only take a plate from the top of the stack, and you can only add a plate to the top of the stack.

## Operations performed on Stack
* Push         : Adds an item in the stack. If the stack is full, then it is said to be an Overflow condition.
* Pop          : Removes an item from the stack. The items are popped in the reversed order in which they are pushed. If the stack is empty, then it is said to be an Underflow condition.
* Peek or Top  : Returns the top element of the stack.
* isEmpty      : Returns `true` if the stack is empty, else `false`.

## Implementation of Stack
Stack can be implemented by following two methods:
1.  Using Array
2.  Using Linked List
